Copilot4Games 1.0

Overview

Copilot4Games 1.0 is an AI-powered game development repository where GitHub Copilot is used to generate and assist in building various game prototypes and mechanics. This project showcases how AI can rapidly accelerate game development, generating functional prototypes with minimal manual coding.

Features

AI-Generated Pong: A fully functional Pong game written in Python using Pygame, featuring AI opponents, procedurally generated sounds, and smooth 60 FPS gameplay.

Game Prototypes: Various experiments and AI-assisted game development projects, including upcoming Mario 64 in Ursina and Portal in C.

Optimized Code: Code generated and optimized with GitHub Copilot to improve efficiency and rapid prototyping.

Installation
